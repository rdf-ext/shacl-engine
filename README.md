# shacl-engine

[![build status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/rdf-ext/shacl-engine/test.yaml?branch=master)](https://github.com/rdf-ext/shacl-engine/actions/workflows/test.yaml)
[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/shacl-engine.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shacl-engine)

A fast [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) engine for data provided as [RDF/JS](http://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/) objects.

The package can be tested on the [SHACL Playground](https://playground.rdf-ext.org/shacl/), which runs client-side in the browser.
Additionally, with [rdf-ext-cli](https://github.com/rdf-ext/rdf-ext-cli), there is a command-line tool for validating RDF data from files, URLs, or even SPARQL endpoints.

**Ô∏èüî•Ô∏èüî• Experimental Branch üî•Ô∏èÔ∏èüî•**

This is a branch for experimental features.
See the features sections for more details.

## Features

SHACL consists of multiple modules.
Here is an overview of SHACL features this library implements and planned features:

- [X] [SHACL Validation](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#validation)
  - [X] [SHACL Core Constraint Components](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#core-components)
  - [X] [SHACL SPARQL-based Constraints](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#sparql-constraints)
- [ ] [SHACL JavaScript Extensions](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl-js/)
- [ ] [SHACL Advanced Features](https://w3c.github.io/shacl/shacl-af/)

Additional features include:

- Debug output in the validation report, showing passed validations and traversing steps.
- Coverage support, providing a subgraph of all triples covered by the shape.

### Experimental

This branch contains experimental features related to the upcoming [SHACL 1.2 specifications](https://github.com/w3c/data-shapes), as well as features that are currently under discussion.
These features are in the early stages of development and may not be fully stable or complete.
As such, they should be used with caution and are not yet part of the official release.

- [X] Node Expressions
  - [X] support for Node Expressions in `sh:deactivated`
  - [X] support for Node Expressions in `sh:path`
  - [X] support for Node Expressions in `sh:targetNode` 
  - [X] support for `sh:values`
  - [X] support for Node Expressions for the following Core Constraint Components:
    - [ ] Cardinality
    - [ ] Logical
    - [X] Other: `sh:in`
    - [ ] Property Pair
    - [ ] Shape-based
    - [ ] String-based
    - [X] Value Range: `sh:maxExclusive`, `sh:maxInclusive`, `sh:minExclusive`, `sh:minInclusive`
    - [ ] Value Type:
  - [X] support for SPARQL-based Node Expressions

See the `test/assets/custom12` folder for examples on how to use the new features.
A list of supported Node Expression Functions can be found in the `lib/functions.js` JavaScript file.

### Performance

The package offers significant performance improvements, being 15-26x faster than other JavaScript or Python packages.
It demonstrates a 15x speed boost in a benchmark that validates [shacl-shacl](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#shacl-shacl) shapes against themselves, with even greater gains (26x faster) in larger, [real-world examples](https://github.com/rdf-ext/shacl-engine/issues/12#issuecomment-1940875628).
For more details about the benchmark, see [this blog post](https://www.bergnet.org/2023/03/2023/shacl-engine/).

## Install

```bash
npm install --save shacl-engine
```

## Usage

### Validator

The `Validator` class can be imported from the main package:

```javascript
import { Validator } from 'shacl-engine'
```

Or from the class file:

```javascript
import Validator from 'shacl-engine/Validator.js'
```

The constructor must be called with the shapes as an RDF/JS [DatasetCore](https://rdf.js.org/dataset-spec/#datasetcore-interface) object.
The second argument is an object for various options:

- `coverage`: Boolean flag to enable collecting covered quads. (*optional*)
  If coverage is enabled, `debug`, `details`, and `trace` are also enabled.
- `debug`: Generate debug results for successful validations. (*optional*)
- `details`: Generate nested result details. (*optional*)
- `factory`: A RDF/JS [DataFactory](http://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/#datafactory-interface), which is used to generate the report (*required*).
- `trace`: Generate results for path traversing. (*optional*)

The validations can be executed with the `.validate(data, shapes)` method.
The data must have the following structure:

- `dataset`: An RDF/JS [DatasetCore](https://rdf.js.org/dataset-spec/#datasetcore-interface) object that contains the quads. (*required*)
- `terms`: An iterable object of RDF/JS [Terms](http://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/#term-interface) that will be used as initial focus nodes. (*optional*)

The shapes object is optional, but if given must have the following structure:

- `terms`: An iterable object of RDF/JS [Terms](http://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/#term-interface) that refers to the initial set of shapes. (*optional*)
  This doesn't limit the nested shapes.

#### Example

The following example reads the shapes and data from the list coverage test, creates a `Validator` instance, and runs the validation:

```javascript
import rdfDataModel from '@rdfjs/data-model'
import rdfDataset from '@rdfjs/dataset'
import toNT from '@rdfjs/to-ntriples'
import fromFile from 'rdf-utils-fs/fromFile.js'
import Validator from 'shacl-engine/Validator.js'

async function main () {
  // read the shape and data from the list coverage test
  const filename = new URL('../test/assets/coverage/list.ttl', import.meta.url)
  const dataset = rdfDataset.dataset()

  for await (const quad of fromFile(filename.pathname)) {
    dataset.add(quad)
  }

  // create a validator instance for the shapes in the given dataset
  const validator = new Validator(dataset, { factory: rdfDataModel })

  // run the validation process
  const report = await validator.validate({ dataset })

  // check if the data conforms to the given shape
  console.log(`conforms: ${report.conforms}`)
}

main()
```

See the `examples` folders for more examples.

### SPARQL Support

The `Validator` comes with the core SHACL validations out-of-the-box.
Additional functions and validations must be added for SPARQL support.
The validations can be imported from `shacl-engine/sparql.js` as shown below:

```javascript
import rdfDataModel from '@rdfjs/data-model'
import { functions as sparqlFunctions, validations as sparqlValidations } from 'shacl-engine/sparql.js'

const validator = new Validator(dataset, {
  factory: rdfDataModel,
  functions: sparqlFunctions,
  validations: sparqlValidations
})
```
